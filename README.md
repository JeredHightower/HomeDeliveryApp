# Quick Start Guide for Home Delivery App
  

This app is designed to help speed up the processes around manifest. This application will require the new "Cage Log.xlsx" to track locations of orders.

 

## Cage Log 
Just fill out the columns as they are listed.

  

## 1. Compare Manifests to Log 
This screen is intended for end of day in home delivery to figure out missing orders, orders not on manifest, and produce locations. 

  

This screen will require that you download a copy of "Cage Log.xlsx" to your computer after filling it out, then selecting it in the app. 

It will also require that you download all the manifests, make a new folder, and place them in there using file explorer. Then select that folder in the app. 

  

After selecting both, click the generate button and screens for "Extra Orders" (orders not on any manifest) and screens for each truck will appear.  If you mistyped an order number, it would appear here. 

Orders will be sorted in reverse alphabetical order based on locations from the cage log.

*(After clicking ‘Generate’ give the app about ~30 seconds to load)*

*Tip: After generating a result, press CTRL+P to print the page*

## 2. Compare Manifests (Auto) 
This screen is intended to find the differences between pre manifest and final manifest (automatically matching truck numbers) in the morning. 

  

Download all pre manifests, make a new folder, and place them in there using file explorer.  

Download all final manifests, make a new folder, and place them in there using file explorer. 

Then select each folder in the app and click generate. What was added and removed from each one will be shown. (After clicking ‘Generate’ give the app about ~30 seconds to load) 

  

The "Cage Log.xlsx" can be selected to add locations for all the orders (but it is not required).

## 3. Compare Manifests (Manual) 
Functionally the same as auto except that you select each pre and final manifest file and generate each result. 

It is necessary to use this screen if truck numbers are changed from pre to final manifest.
